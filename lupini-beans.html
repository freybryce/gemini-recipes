        <h1 itemprop="name">How to Cook Lupini Beans from Dry Beans</h1>
        <p itemprop="description">Preparing dry lupini beans requires patience, but the result is a delicious and nutritious snack or ingredient. This process involves extensive soaking and rinsing to remove bitter alkaloids, making them safe and pleasant to eat.</p>

        <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong> <time datetime="P1D">1 day (initial soak)</time></p>
        <p><strong>Cook Time:</strong> <time datetime="PT90M">1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours</time></p>
        <p><strong>Debittering Time:</strong> <time datetime="P5D">5 to 14 days</time></p>
        <p><strong>Total Time:</strong> <time datetime="P7D">Approximately 7 to 16 days</time></p>
        <p><strong>Yield:</strong> <span itemprop="recipeYield">Varies depending on the quantity of dry beans (e.g., 1 lb dry beans yields about 3-4 lbs cooked)</span></p>

        <div class="ingredients">
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lb (approx. 450g) dry lupini beans (preferably sweet variety for easier debittering)</li>
                <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Plenty of cold water for soaking and boiling</li>
                <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1/4 cup Kosher salt or sea salt (for brining, adjust to taste)</li>
            </ul>

                <h3 itemprop="name">Step 1: Sort and Initial Soak (24-48 hours)</h3>
                <p itemprop="text">Carefully sort through the dry lupini beans, discarding any discolored, wrinkled, or damaged beans. Rinse them thoroughly under cold running water. Place the cleaned beans in a large bowl or pot and cover them with ample cold water, ensuring the water level is at least 3-4 inches above the beans, as they will expand significantly. Soak the beans in the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours. During this time, the beans should become plump and lose their wrinkled appearance. Drain the water completely after soaking.</p>

                <h3 itemprop="name">Step 2: First Boil (90-120 minutes)</h3>
                <p itemprop="text">Transfer the soaked and drained beans to a large pot. Cover them with fresh cold water, again ensuring at least 2-3 inches of water above the bean level. Bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer, cover the pot, and cook for 90 minutes to 2 hours, or until the beans are tender but still retain their shape. The cooking time may vary based on the size and freshness of your beans. Pressure cooker users can cook for 20-30 minutes at high pressure with natural release, but still require the long desalting process.</p>

                <h3 itemprop="name">Step 3: The Debittering Process (5-14 days)</h3>
                <p itemprop="text">Drain the cooked lupini beans and rinse them thoroughly with cold water. Transfer them to a large clean bowl or container. Cover the beans completely with fresh cold water. This is the crucial desalting and debittering phase. For the next 5 to 14 days, you must drain and replace the water at least twice a day (ideally every 12 hours). Some prefer to add about 1-2 tablespoons of salt per gallon of water during this soaking phase, which can help in drawing out the bitterness and adds flavor, but it's optional. Keep the beans refrigerated throughout this entire process. Each time you change the water, taste a bean (do not swallow if still very bitter) to check for bitterness. The bitterness should gradually decrease with each water change. Continue this process until all bitterness is gone and the beans taste pleasant and slightly sweet or nutty.</p>

                <h3 itemprop="name">Step 4: Final Brining and Storage</h3>
                <p itemprop="text">Once the lupini beans are completely de-bittered, drain them one last time. Prepare a final brine by dissolving approximately 1/4 cup of Kosher salt or sea salt per gallon of cold water (adjust salt to your preference). You can add optional flavorings to this brine, such as bay leaves, garlic cloves, or sprigs of rosemary. Place the de-bittered lupini beans into clean jars or an airtight container and cover them completely with the prepared brine. Store the brined lupini beans in the refrigerator. They can be stored this way for up to 2-4 weeks.</p>

                <h3 itemprop="name">Step 5: Serving</h3>
                <p itemprop="text">When ready to serve, drain the desired amount of lupini beans from the brine. You can enjoy them as is, or toss them with a drizzle of olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice, chopped fresh parsley, and a pinch of black pepper. Traditionally, the outer skin of the lupini bean is peeled before eating, but it is edible and some prefer to eat it.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <h2>Notes:</h2>
            <p><strong>Bitterness is Normal:</strong> Lupini beans naturally contain bitter alkaloids that are toxic if consumed in large quantities. The prolonged soaking and frequent water changes are essential to remove these compounds and make the beans safe and palatable.</p>
            <p><strong>Sweet vs. Bitter Varieties:</strong> While this recipe works for most dry lupini beans, some varieties are "sweet" lupini beans, which may require a shorter debittering period. However, it is always safest to follow the full debittering process and taste-test thoroughly.</p>
            <p><strong>Peeling the Skin:</strong> Most people prefer to peel the thin, slightly tough outer skin of the lupini bean before eating. This is done by gently biting or squeezing the bean to pop out the inner kernel. The skin is edible, but its texture can be less desirable.</p>
            <p><strong>Storage:</strong> Ensure the beans remain submerged in the brine during storage to prevent spoilage.</p>
