            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¾ cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¾ cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 large eggs</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 ½ cups white chocolate chips or chunks</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup dried cranberries</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup dried blueberries</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div itemprop="recipeInstructions">
            <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</p>

            <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened unsalted butter, granulated sugar, and light brown sugar using an electric mixer on medium speed. Continue mixing until the mixture is light and fluffy, which usually takes about 2-3 minutes.</p>

            <p>Beat in the large eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla extract until well combined.</p>

            <p>In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt until thoroughly combined.</p>

            <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed just until the flour is incorporated. Be careful not to overmix the dough, as this can lead to tough cookies.</p>

            <p>Gently fold in the white chocolate chips, dried cranberries, and dried blueberries using a spatula or wooden spoon. Mix until they are evenly distributed throughout the cookie dough.</p>

            <p>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches of space between each cookie to allow for spreading during baking.</p>

            <p>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are lightly golden and the centers are just set. They may still look slightly soft in the middle, but will firm up as they cool.</p>

            <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for about 5 minutes before carefully transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Store leftover cookies in an airtight container at room temperature.</p>
